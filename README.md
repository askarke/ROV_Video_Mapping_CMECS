# ROV_Video_Mapping_CMECS

A series of python scripts for QGIS that automate digital mapping of seafloor substrate distribution observed in video data collected with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV).

This project is an automated system for the digital mapping of seafloor substrate observed in video data acquired during dives of the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Deep Discoverer aboard NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer. It contains a series of Python scripts and associated standard operating procedure (SOP) documents that automate the generation of color-coded seafloor substrate maps and resultant GIS shapefiles (e.g. dive track, seafloor area viewed, and substrate observation) from ROV and shipboard data records. The mapped substrate classes are categorized with the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) (https://iocm.noaa.gov/standards/cmecs-home.html). The source data used are scientific annotations created in Ocean Networks Canadaâ€™s (ONC) SeaTube v2 software, by scientists participating in NOAA Ship Okeanos Explorer expeditions, as well as navigation data and environmental sensor observations from the NOAA ROV Deep Discoverer. The resulting Python scripts and supporting SOP documents allow end users to visualize geospatial relationships within NOAA ROV video data.
